# Musician – [musician.lenwe.io](https://musician.lenwe.io)

Musician is an UI add-on for *World of Warcraft* that provides music playing capability to the players. Unlike other popular MMORPGs such as *Lord of the Rings Online* or *Final Fantasy XIV*, *World of Warcraft* lacks a "bard class" or "music performance mode" which is highly appreciated by roleplayers. The goal of Musician is to fill this gap the best as possible using the limited features of the WoW UI API.

The add-on consists in a rudimentary sample-based synthesizer of 24 instruments. These are mostly medieval and renaissance instruments to match WoW's medieval fantasy universe. More instruments can be added as plugins.

Music can be played from MIDI files, using the computer keyboard or a MIDI controller. The other players – who also have the add-on – and who are within range of the character can also listen to the music. Since add-ons have no control over the player's 3D avatar – for example to add an instrument model – the visual feedback is limited to animated notes showing above the player's nameplate. However, some standard in-game items and techniques can be used to improve the immersive experience.

# Adaptive controller for World of Warcraft

The goal of this project was to make Romain, a World of Warcraft friend with severe disability, to regain control of the game so he could play again, despîte the evolution of his condition.

The core of the project is a [Makey Makey](https://makeymakey.com/) card, a cheap and fun toy that can turn almost any conductive object into a standard PC keyboard and mouse input. Using salvaged wires, tape, zip ties and some freeware such as [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and custom scripts, we managed to give him back full control to the game.
